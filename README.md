# Simple Autoclicker

It wasn't really intended to be an autoclicker in the first place, it actually started out as a simple keylogger. However I shimmied it into a janky clicker, its functional though.

## How to use
1. You obviously need to compile it first, theres a .vcxproj and .sln file in the directory, if you have visual studio you can double-click one of these to open the project and compile it.

2. Choose your clicks per second range, it has bad randomization so don't depend on it being very good.

3. Press 'P' to toggle on/off, it will click on mouse-down if toggled on.

Have fun
